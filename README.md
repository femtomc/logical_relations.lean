# (Lean) Programming language semantics 
The study of programming languages involves an imposing combination of theory, mathematics, and practical understanding of certain models of computation. I'm still learning myself, and a good way to learn is to teach...

But you can't teach if you don't know that what you're talking about is correct. Hence, a plan formed -- what if I learn, and transcribe what I learn as code in Lean 4, which will then allow me to prove that what I'm saying is correct.

## Things to keep in mind

This repository reflects my own learning goals.
* Understanding techniques in the semantics of programming language, with a focus on operational and denotational semantics.
* Understand _how to say things_ about languages, and how _to prove that the things you say are true_.
